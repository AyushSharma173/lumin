        <p>
          Lumin is a research‑driven company focused on advancing the state of AI agents through 
          systematic experimentation and rigorous evaluation. We specialize in building long‑horizon 
          agents with human‑in‑the‑loop training infrastructure.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our approach</h2>
        <p>
          We bridge the gap between cutting‑edge research and practical deployment by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Conducting systematic ablations to validate latest techniques</li>
          <li>Building domain‑specific evaluation suites that correlate with real‑world performance</li>
          <li>Developing training infrastructure for human feedback integration</li>
          <li>Implementing robust engineering practices for production deployment</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research methodology</h2>
        <p>
          Our work combines rigorous experimentation with practical engineering. We start with 
          academic breakthroughs, conduct controlled studies to understand their limitations, 
          and build production‑ready systems that deliver measurable value to end users.
