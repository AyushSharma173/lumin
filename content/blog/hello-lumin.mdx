excerpt: Agents, RL, and infra for realâ€‘world tasks.

Welcome to Lumin. We build agents that do real work in the real world.

## Why now

Better models, better tools, and better evaluation let us close the loop from research to deployment.

## A tiny chart

## A bit of math

We like clear objectives. For example, expected utility \(\mathbb{E}[U]\) under constraints:

\[\max_{\pi} \; \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi}[U(\tau)] \quad \text{s.t.} \; C(\tau) \leq 
\kappa\]

Stay tuned for deep dives on agents, RL envs, and infra.
