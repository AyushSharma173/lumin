Coming soon! This post will dive deep into evaluating tool-use agents and building benchmarks that actually correlate with real-world outcomes.

We'll explore:

- **Task completion metrics** that matter
- **Efficiency measurements** beyond token counts  
- **Safety evaluation** frameworks
- **Cost optimization** strategies
- **Real-world correlation** studies

Stay tuned for practical insights on building evaluation systems that drive better agent performance.
