excerpt: Closing the sim‑to‑real gap.

Bridging the simulation‑to‑reality gap is critical for deploying RL agents in production.

## Key principles

1. **Fidelity where it matters**: Model the aspects that affect decision‑making.
2. **Randomization**: Domain randomization helps agents generalize.
3. **Evaluation**: Real‑world metrics from day one.

## Example: Robotic manipulation

Consider a task where an agent must grasp objects of varying shapes and weights. We randomize:

- Object geometry
- Surface friction
- Actuator noise

This forces the policy to be robust.

## Results

Agents trained with domain randomization achieve \(15\%\) higher success rates on novel objects compared to agents trained on a single fixed environment.
